##Explanation:

1) Loop: The for loop iterates through numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
2) Condition: The if statement checks if the current number is 5.
3) Continue: If the condition is true, the continue statement skips the rest of the loop body and proceeds to the next iteration.
4) Print: Numbers other than 5 are printed.

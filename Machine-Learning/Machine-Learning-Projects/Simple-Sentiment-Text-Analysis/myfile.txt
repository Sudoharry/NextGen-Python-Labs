Last night I do have a horror experience and I was in the middle of night, had really nightmare about ghost even my mind was unstoppable.

I could stop myself to stop thinking about the ghost activity. It was horrible experience. I wasn't able to sleep after that dreams.

There was a lot of ups and down in the middle of the night and really had no idea how to deal with the situation. I was finally able to sleep after 4:00 a.m

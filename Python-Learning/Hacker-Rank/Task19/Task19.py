"""
Splitting the string

The input string s is divided into equal-sized substrings of length k.
Since k is a factor of n, s is evenly divisible.
Removing duplicate occurrences

A set (seen) is used to track unique characters in each substring.
Only the first occurrence of a character is kept in the order it appears.
Printing results

Each processed substring (uáµ¢) is printed on a new line.

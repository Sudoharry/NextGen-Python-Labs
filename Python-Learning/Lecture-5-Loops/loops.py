# count = 1 ## count in this case is considered as iterator and it do iteration until it reach the desired value
# while count <=15 :    #This indicates that the count will continue until it reaches the 15
#    print("Hello") # This will print Hello until it reaches 15
#    count += 1    # As count values should get increases, as if it won't then it would be less than 15. So, we have to increase the value of the count on every iteration


## Second way to iterate a while loop
# i = 1
# while i <=10 :
#    print("Hello", i)  # This would print the i values in the iteration loop
#    i += 1  


# i = 1
# while i <=10:
#    print(i)
#    i += 1
# print("Loop ended")  # this will end the loop once it reaches the 10, and it will keep print iteration of i until it reaches the 10.


## Print reverse from 10

i = 10
while i >= 1:
   print(i)
   i -= 1
print("Loop ended")

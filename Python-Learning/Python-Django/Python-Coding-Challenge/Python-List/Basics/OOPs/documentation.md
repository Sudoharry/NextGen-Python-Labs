Principle	How Itâ€™s Applied

1. Clean Code	Follows PEP8, uses clear function/class names, and modular design
2. Collaboration Simulation	Functions simulate API-style methods (borrow_book, return_book)
3. Debugging	Logging added for borrow/return events and errors
4. Staying Updated	Uses dicts, sets, comprehensions, and idiomatic Python
5. Code Review Friendly	Docstrings and comments provided; functions are readable and reusable
6. Documentation	Each function/class documents purpose and usage
7. Performance Refactoring	Genre tracking uses set comprehension for speed and uniqueness
8. Python Proficiency	Demonstrates object-oriented programming, collections, logic flow, and structure
